My work involved meticulously researching and writing in-depth profiles that honored the lives lost to gun violence. By humanizing statistics through stories of individual victims, I aimed to shift the public discourse from desensitization to empathy, highlighting their names, faces, experiences, and aspirations. This project sought to bring awareness to the epidemic of youth gun violence, emphasizing that each life lost is a profound tragedy that demands our attention and action. Through these narratives, I helped amplify the voices of those who could no longer speak for themselves, advocating for a deeper understanding of the devastating impact of firearm violence on our communities.',
