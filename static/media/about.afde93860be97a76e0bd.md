# My 'interesting' take on religion and religious beliefs

When asked about my religion, I often find it challenging to put it into a single label, as my 'religion' is a blend of various beliefs and philosophies that resonate with me on a deeper level. However, at the core of my religious belief is the idea that we are all connected in this world, and that there is a higher power that exists beyond us. This belief centers around the ideas of interconnectedness and self-discovery.

<br />

Interconnectedness is the understanding that we are all a part of a larger whole. We are not just individuals living separate lives, but we are all connected to one another, and to the world around us. However, I don't believe in personifying this higher power, as I think that would limit our understanding of it. Our souls reflect this divine energy, giving us the ability to carve out our own paths in life with willingness and freedom. This belief is similar to the Buddhist concept of interdependence, which states that all things are interconnected and that everything we do has an impact on the world around us.

<br />

My beliefs are also heavily influenced by the philosophy of existentialism and the concept of the Ubermensch. Existentialism emphasizes individualism and self-determination. I find great inspiration in Friedrich Nietzsche's concept of the Ubermensch, or Superman, which encourages us to create our own independent values to guide our lives, free from the constraints of societal norms and expectations. This philosophy encourages us to take ownership of our lives, to be responsible for our choices and actions. One poem that has had a significant impact on my spiritual journey is "Invictus" by William Ernest Henley, which speaks to the resilience and inner strength that comes from recognizing our own power and taking ownership of our lives.

<br />

My moral compass is guided by a variety of ideas, including Confucianism, Taoism, and Hinduism. Confucianism provides a framework for developing virtues like compassion and respect, which can help us reach peace within ourselves and our communities. Taoism emphasizes the balance between opposing forces like yin and yang, which can help us find harmony in our lives. Hinduism, with its focus on chakras and the idea that god is the universe as a whole, helps me connect to the larger, interconnected nature of the world around us.

<br />

Over time, my beliefs have evolved into a unique blend that feels authentic to me. While my religious background may have started with Buddhism and Unitarianism, I am constantly seeking new ideas and perspectives to expand my understanding of the world and my place in it. As a person of faith, I believe that it is important to be open to new ideas and perspectives, to listen and learn from others, and to continuously strive to become a better version of ourselves.

<br />

Overall, my religion centers around the ideas of interconnectedness and self-discovery. It is a blend of various beliefs and philosophies that resonate with me on a deeper level. My beliefs are influenced by the philosophy of existentialism, the concept of the Ubermensch, and the traditions of Confucianism, Taoism, and Hinduism. I am constantly seeking new ideas and perspectives to expand my understanding of the world and my place in it.
